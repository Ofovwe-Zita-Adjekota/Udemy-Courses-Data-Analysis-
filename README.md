### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the total performance of an online education company from the period of 2011 to 2017. By analyzing various aspects of the course data, I sought to identify trends, gain deeper understanding of the compnay's performance over the period and make data-driven recommendations.

### Data Sources

The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "data-udemy-courses" file from Kaggle.com, containing detailed information about the courses offered, subscribers and their levels, amongst other information in various sheets and columns.

  ### Data Cleaning

In the initial data preparation stage, i carried out the folowing tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection,
2. Handling missing values,
3. Data cleaning and formatting
4. Appended Tables

### Explanatory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the courses data to answer key questions such as: 

- What is the overall subscription to Udemy courses?
- Which course is most registered for?
- What subject has the highest number of subscribers?

### Findings
The analysis results are summarised as follows:
1. Udemy has a large number of subscribers with those at all levels being the highest.
2. The Learn HTML5 Programming From Scratch is the trending course as it has the highest number of subscribers.
3. Likeweise, Web Development subject attracts more people as it has the highest number of subscibers.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, I recommend the following:
1. Subjects like Musical Instruments and every other subject should be prompted to subscribers for increased number of subscribers.
2. Similarly, courses with very minimal subscribers should be promoted for more subscribers.

### Limitation
- Basically, only a few of the data from the dataset was worthy to create insights from.
